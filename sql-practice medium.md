```sql
SELECT patient_id, attending_doctor_id, diagnosis
FROM admissions
WHERE patient_id % 2 = 1 AND attending_doctor_id IN (1, 5, 19)
   OR (attending_doctor_id LIKE '%2%' AND LENGTH(patient_id) = 3);
```
19.Show first_name, last_name, and the total number of admissions attended for each doctor. Every admission has been attended by a doctor.

```sql

```
22.For every admission, display the patient's full name, their admission diagnosis, and their doctor's full name who diagnosed their problem.
```sql
SELECT concat(patients.first_name, ' ', patients.last_name) as patient_name, diagnosis, concat(doctors.first_name, ' ', doctors.last_name)

JOIN doctors ON doctors.doctor_id = admissions.attending_doctor_id
```
23. display the number of duplicate patients based on their first_name and last_name.
```sql
    SELECT patient_id, diagnosis

    GROUP BY patient_id, diagnosis
    HAVING COUNT(diagnosis = diagnosis) > 1;
```
25.  Display patient's full name,height in the units feet ROUNDed to 1 decimal,weight in the unit pounds ROUNDed to 0 decimals,birth_date,gender non abbreviated. Convert CM to feet by dividing by 30.48. Convert KG to pounds by multiplying by 2.205.

```sql
SELECT
